Recipe App Project
------------------
This repository hosts the collaborative team project for a recipe application.

In this root directory, you'll find three main folders:

+ `backend-server` - Houses the backend project with node.js. For setup instructions and more information, please refer to the `README` 
within this directory.
+ `docs` - Contains architectural documents, requirements, user stories, visuals, and diagrams.
+ `frontend-server` - Holds the UI (frontend) application. Built on the Svelte framework.


## Documentation

Lots of work was put into the architectural design, domain modeling, and user story creation 
for our application. All team members are encourage to familiarize themselves with this 
foundational documentation to understand the core concepts and the rationale behind the key design decisions.

### Location

All the relevant documents are meticulously organized and can be found under the `docs` directory of this repository.

### Contents

Here's what you'll find in the `docs` directory:

- `domain-model-description.md`: A detailed explanation of our domain model and 
the justifications for design choices.
- `user-stories.md`: A few user stories we're aiming to satisfy with this project, 
providing a clear view of our objectives from the user's perspective.
- `domain-model-diagrams`: Visuals and diagrams.

## Contribution

Please contribute to the documentation as well. If you see an area that can be improved or 
have suggestions based on new developments, please feel free to update the documents or discuss your ideas with the team.

Let's keep our documentation as dynamic and collaborative as our codebase!
