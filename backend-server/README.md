Back-end Project
--------------------

Welcome to our server application, also known as the 
back-end, for our recipe index.

## Technology Stack

Our back-end is built using the following technologies:

+ `Node.js` - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
+ `Express` - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
+ `PostgreSQL` - A powerful, open-source relational database management system.

## How to Setup

This project depends on the `build` directory of the `frontend-server`. 
Make sure that you run `npm run build` inside the `frontend-server`. 

The root docker compose has been set to make a proper volume for the build version 
of the frontend-server.
