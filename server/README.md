Back-end Project

Welcome to our server application, also known as the 
back-end, for our recipe app.

## Technology Stack

Our back-end is built using the following technologies:

+ `Node.js` - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
+ `Express` - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
+ `PostgreSQL` - A powerful, open-source relational database management system.
